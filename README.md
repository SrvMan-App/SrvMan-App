# SrvMan Windows App

Service Manager provides the ability to manage Windows services efficiently. This lightweight, portable software offers detailed technical information about running services and allows users to create or remove them as needed.

Since there’s no installer required, you can store the program files on a USB drive or any location on your hard disk. Simply run the executable to launch Service Manager on any computer without prior setup.

## Features
The application features a classic interface with a large window displaying an organized layout. It lists all currently active services and provides information such as internal name, status, type (e.g., Win32, driver), display name, start type (e.g., manual, boot, system), and the complete path to the executable.

Additional details include the user-visible name, binary file path (both raw and Win32), load order group, logon credentials, and service description. Users can modify the service type, startup mode, binary path, load order group, and description as necessary.

In addition to viewing and editing, the tool allows you to stop, restart, or delete services. You can also add new services, adjust column visibility in the main window, and refresh the displayed data. However, it doesn’t offer extensive options beyond these features.

During testing, the program demonstrated stability with no crashes, freezes, or error prompts. Its impact on system performance was minimal, requiring low CPU and memory usage.

While Service Manager may lack advanced features or extensive configuration settings, it provides a straightforward way to monitor and manage Windows services. It’s suitable for users of all experience levels. However, it’s worth noting that the software hasn’t been updated in a long time, which may limit compatibility with newer systems.
